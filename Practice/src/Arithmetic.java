/*Comment
 This is a interactive java program that uses's Java's arithmetic operators as well as the Scanner object 
 to obtain input from the user. This program will perform the following operations. 
 the opposite of n is y
   n doubled is y
   one-half of n is y
   n squared is y
   the reciprocal of n is y
   one-tenth of n is y and y squared is z
   n minus the last digit of n is y
   the sum of n and n+1 and n+2 is y
